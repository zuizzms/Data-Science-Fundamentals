A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. 
You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. 
You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. 
How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fairness of the coin? 
Explain your reasoning a bit.


I think 10 times total is enough for me to start doubting the fairness of the coin.
Assuming that each flip is completely random and the coin has a 50/50 chance of landing
on heads or tails, there is a 0.5^10 = 0.0977% chance probability of heads coming all 10 times. 
This is very unlikely, and so, if this happened, I would begin to doubt the fairness. 
A more official way to test this would be to use a binomial test where we use a significance level
of 0.05, flip the coin 10 times, and calculate the p value to see if the number of heads is 
statistically significant. For me, personally, after 10, I would be suspicious.
